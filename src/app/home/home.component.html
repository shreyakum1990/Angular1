<h1>What is Angular?</h1>

<p>Angular is a client side framework. A javascript framework to be precise. And what does that mean client side javascript frameworks like angular alternatives would be  reworked. JS future yes. Amber js a couple of hours all have the goal of enabling you as a developer to focus on your core business logic and create awesome user experiences.</p>
<p>Awesome web apps and they run on the browser for one single reason or day are about running code in the browser for this single reason if you think about native mobile apps for example if you tap a button there things happen instantly right. We with a very reactive application. We don't have to wait for pages to reload.</p>
<p>Now in the web that's a different story. If you visit web pages you have a higher chance of actually clicking a link and while loading a different. Page on the same overall web page still having to wait for the new page to load. And it take a couple of Moli seconds up to seconds. Now a better user experience would be if things would happen instantly and that exactly is what framework's like angular allow you to build applications where is the case.</p>
<p>These are so called single page applications because technically we only ship one page one HTML outfall to the user days. HTML file contains the framework Angular and our own code which connects to the framework and it will basically ensure that all the parts of this page of the DOM. That;s the parsed HTML code in the browser are basically parts of that storm which need to be updated are updated.</p>
<p>So for example if we open a dialog we simply add that dialog to the dom or angular or dusted for us to be precise. That's why it's a javascript framework because javascript is the only language which runs on the browser and which allows us to change the content of the page after it has been loaded and with frameworks like angular we have a way of accessing this feature set and of creating a very reactive web applications which provide awesome user experience because things happen instantly and to the user it might still look like it actually switched a page because maybe we really rendered the whole page.</p>
<p>We rewrote the whole page html code but all that happened in javascript and therefore in the loaded page without a new request being sent to the server and a new page being served back and this better user experience which makes javascript frameworks like angular very popular and which allows you as a developer to create great user  experiences with such frameworks. Now that's the theory it will certainly become more clearer once we see it in action. </p>
