<h1>How Angular Works?</h1>
<p>But actually it uses typescript a superset to javascript typescript is a language invented by Microsoft. Which doesn't run in the browser and therefore we can't write our app in typescript and expected to run like this in te browser. But we can compile it to javascript and actually typescript the language ships with its own compiler which does just that.</p>
<p>The Angular team chose typescript  as their primary language for angular's development. There are couple of reasons for that. Typescript is an awesome language. In the end which adds new features to javascript which really enhanced the language te most prominent additions is the one which gave typescript its name. The addition of types by default Javascript is a weekly type language.</p>
<p>So if we have a variable which stores some text it is indeed of type string but it doesn't really care if we then assign a number to this variable.</p>
<p>We are able to switch types of variables off properties all the time and that makes our app less predictable and harder to debug and to test with typescript.</p>
<p>These problems are eliminated because typescript allows us to strongly tie up our variables so that so we clearly assign a type to a variable to a property whatever it is.</p>
<p>And if we ever during development make the mistake of assigning a wrong type of value which is not the right type we get a warning. So that was the reason why type was chosen as a language.</p>
<p>As we said it doesn't run like this in the browser. So in the build word it's low which we actually need to set up. We have to compile typescript to javascript that has one important application.</p>
